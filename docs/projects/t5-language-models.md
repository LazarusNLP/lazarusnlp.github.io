title: "Indonesian T5 Language Models"
description: "This project focuses on pre-training a T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model specifically for the Indonesian language, using nanoT5 as its training framework. Our aim is to provide fully open-source, budget-constrained, sequence-to-sequence language models for Indonesia that are on-par with state-of-the-art models!"
